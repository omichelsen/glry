Image gallery with mobile/touch support and no dependencies.

__[See the demo](http://rawgit.com/omichelsen/glry/master/demo/index.html)__

Does not require you to specify all the images in the markup beforehand, instead you supply a `load` function which returns the next/prev image. This makes it ideal for large or dynamic galleries, where the images should be loaded based on changing logic.

glry is also used as a base for [daily-glry](https://github.com/omichelsen/daily-glry.git), which is an extension specifically designed for daily comic strips.

## Install

With npm:

```bash
$ npm install glry --save
```

or bower:

```bash
$ bower install glry --save
```

Include the library in your web page:

```html
<script src="bower_components/glry/glry.js"></script>
```

## Usage

Place some basic HTML on your page:

```html
<figure id="figure">
    <div class="loading">LOADING</div>
    <div class="error">ERROR</div>
    <nav class="navigation">
        <button class="prev">◀</button>
        <button class="next">▶</button>
    </nav>
</figure>
```

Initialize the gallery with a minimal set of options like this:

```js
var glry = new Glry({
    load: function (direction) {
        if (direction === 'left')
            return 'prev-image.jpg';
        else
            return 'next-image.jpg';
    },
    canNavigate: function (direction) {
        return true;
    }
});
```

The only required option is `load` which should be a function that returns the URL of the next/previous image. The function is passed a `direction` parameter indicating whether the navigation direction is "left" or "right".

You can optionally specify a `canNavigate` function, to prevent swiping in a given direction. This can be useful if you don't have an infinite amount of images and want to signal that the user has reached the end (or beginning).

### Options

The available options and their defaults are as follows:

```js
{
    target: '#figure',
    animationSpeed: 250,
    enableKeyboard: true,
    onLoadStart: false,
    onLoadEnd: false
}
```

If you want to do some work before or after an image has loaded, you can pass a function to `onLoadStart`/`onLoadEnd`.

Keyboard navigation is enabled per default, and maps to the <kbd>◀</kbd> / <kbd>▶</kbd> arrow keys to go to next/previous image.
